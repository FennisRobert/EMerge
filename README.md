TO ALL CONTRIBUTORS | PLEASE READ

Hello everybody. Thanks for helping out with my repository. Due to me using a free Github account, I cannot restrict any rights to any of the branches for you. 
This means that you can technically delete/force push to the main branch at your own volition.

On top of that I am not very experienced with Github so please be kind.

Thus please follow the following rules:

1. Don't push anything to the main branch
2. Suggest as many code changes/updates ideas using the Issues feature and/or via the Discord
3. Please make sure that you read the LICENSE file before you share anything with others
