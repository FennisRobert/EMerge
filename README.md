## TO EVERYBODY, PLEASE READ

Hello everybody. Thanks for showing interest in this repository. Due to me using a free Github account managing a private repository got too frustrating. 

If all is well it should not be possible for others to push anything to this repository besides me. If you have suggestions/changes/questions either use the Github issue system or join the Discord using the following link:

## Compatibility

As far as I know, the library should work on all systems. PyPARDISO is not supported on ARM but the current SuperLU solver settings should work on ARM as well. I have now implemented a proto version of parallel processing for the `.frequency_domain()` method that can run a simulation on multiple parallel threads. This is work in progress!

## Required libraries

To run this FEM library you need the following libraries

 - numpy
 - scipy
 - pypardiso
 - gmsh
 - loguru
 - numba
 - matplotlib (for the matplotlib base display)
 - pyvista (for the PyVista base display)
 - numba-progress

## NOTICE

First time runs will be very slow because Numba needs to generate local C-compiled functions of the assembler and other mathematical functions. These compilations are chached so this should only take time once.

## How to install

Just download the repository (local clone) and put the "fem" folder plus files in some of your directories.
